******IMPLEMENTATION OF SINGLE SOURCE SHORTEST PATH AND MINIMUM SPANNING TREE IN JAVA******

The project contains two parts namely, Single-source shortest path and Minimum spanning tree.

There are 4 input files out of which 2 are directed graphs and 2 are undirected graphs.

1)Single-source shortest path


A)Run dijkstra.java
B)Enter the file name without any extension and when prompted enter 1 and after the edges are displayed, enter the starting vertex
C)The path to all the vertices from the source vertex is displayed



2)Minimum spanning tree


A)Run dijkstra.java
B)Enter the file name without any extension and when prompted enter 2
C)The edges that form the minimum spanning tree and the final cost is displayed
